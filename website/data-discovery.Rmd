During our data discovery phase, we found business data from the minority-focused Chamber of Commerce websites (Black, Latin, Asian, and Native American), Yelp.com, Small Business Supply Directory (SBSD), and the Axle database. 

The data from the minority-focused Chamber of Commerce sites and Yelp.com were found using web scraping. T

**What is Web-Scrapping?**  Web scraping is a data extraction technique used to gather information from various websites on the internet. It involves automating the process of retrieving and parsing data from web pages, enabling the collection of large datasets quickly and efficiently.

The number of businesses found in each listing is as follows below.

These company names were added to our 'Listing'. The Listing refers to a list of businesses that we have high confidence are minority owned. 

Another dataset that was added to our Listing was the businesses that had been flagged by Mergent Intellect.

This table demonstrates that although the Mergent Intellect dataset may appear large at first, when we found only the businesses that had executive names reported, the number decreased vastly, and after finding those owner name's that also had a minority flag, the number became even smaller, merely 743 businesses.
