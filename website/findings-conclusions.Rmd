### **Implications**

With our model we predicted that as of today, 41.75 % of Fairfax County Businesess are Minority Owned. We hope that with this model, community programs and policymakers across the entire National Capital Region can foster healthier and more diverse business climates within their communities by using accurate information to help encourage initiatives for underserved businesses. These improvements would not only help better our economy but promote representation for underserved groups and prioritize inclusion for all.

### **Limitations**

  Throughout our research, we experienced several limitations and challenges. One challenge was our inability to produce an extensive list of businesses despite web scraping from various sites. This resulted in a smaller list of businesses compared to our main sources. To mitigate this challenge, we carefully balanced the training set, ensuring it comprised 50% of businesses included in the listings and 50% not included. This allowed for a balanced training set, but it is still smaller than it should be. A future application of this project would be to continue searching for more businesses to add to our listing so that the model’s training set can be improved. Additionally, we acknowledge a potential limitation in our approach, wherein census demographic information is based on the number of people living in a particular area. By using this data to infer information about business owners’ locations, we assumed they reside in the same area as their businesses are.
  
### **Next Steps **

The next steps of this would be to grow our training set and our data sets to gain more confidence in our model. We also hope to explore how minority-ownership is distributed geographically and across specific industries. And finally, we hope to apply our classifier model to other geographies covered by the Social Impact Data Commons, such as the National Capital Region.
