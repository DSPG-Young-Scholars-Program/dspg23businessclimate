# Project Summary
The Business Diversity project is a significant part of the Social and Impact Data Commons project. The Data Commons is an open knowledge repository that compiles data from trusted open access sources to provide tools designed to track issues over time and geographical locations. Our project aims to help policy makers and outreach programs track economic diversity—focusing on minority-owned businesses—within Fairfax County, Virginia.

As defined by Mergent intellect and the U.S Census Bureau, a minority-owned business is a US-based enterprise predominantly owned (51% or more) by one or more members of a socially and economically disadvantaged minority group based on race.

Microdata enables the study of minority-owned business activities at small geography levels. This type of data must be accurate upon developing policies at the county and community level. However, current business microdata sources do not adequately identify minority-owned businesses. A case study conducted in Fairfax County revealed that the Annual Business Survey (ABS) reported approximately 38% of minority-owned businesses in 2017. During that same period, Mergent Intellect reported only 7%. Although we do not have Mergent Intellect’s methodology for identifying minority-owned businesses, our preliminary findings suggest that Mergent Intellect includes solely registered minority-owned businesses, underrepresenting those not registered. The inconsistency across these sources leads us to ask these questions:

- How are minority-owned businesses distributed across Fairfax County geographically?
- How are minority-owned businesses distributed across Fairfax County by business type and by industry?

# Project Goals
To help answer these research questions, our goal was to create a binary classification model that can reduce the error in predicting and tracking minority business ownership in Fairfax County, thus, accounting for the underrepresentation in Mergent Intellect’s data. Our classification model consists of three inputs:

- The Business Owner’s Name
- The Company’s Name
- The Company’s Location

For ethical purposes, our model employs the binary classification of minority-owned or non-minority-owned among businesses. Business owners’ racial identifiers are not disclosed to maintain this research’s intended application. We look at business owners’ names as our first predictor; existing research on name analysis suggests that names with distinct cultural or ethnic backgrounds are often associated with minority individuals. As our second predictor, we chose to evaluate the language that a company’s name is written in as another helpful indicator of the company owner’s minority status. Lastly, our third predictor is the population demographics at the business’ locations.

# Summary of Findings
We explored data sources that tracked minority business ownership to build training data for our classifier model. We web scraped and accessed databases that tracked minority business ownership in Fairfax County. We found business data from the minority-focused Chamber of Commerce websites (Black, Latin, Asian, and Native American), Yelp.com, Small Business Supply Directory (SBSD), and the Axle database. At the end of our discovery phase, our training set was an equally balanced sample of the businesses tracked as minority-owned (across Mergent and the additional data discovered) and non-minority-owned (businesses founded before 1964 due to the Civil Rights Act).

The underrepresentation of Mergent Intellect is identified as an ‘error’ and represents the proportion of businesses that were falsely classified as non-minority owned. The error rate of Mergent Intellect was approximately 39%, and the number of businesses correctly classified as minority-owned was around 7%. As our goal was to focus on misclassified businesses within Mergent’s data, we applied our classification model to the non-flagged businesses, including the businesses that were correctly listed as minority-owned. By doing this, we calculated the new percentage of minority-owned businesses, which turned out to be 37.77%. Remarkably, this figure closely aligned with the 38% reported by the ABS census, which was our target percentage. Next, we assessed the error of this updated model and found it to be 26.315%, significantly lower than the initial error rate. This result indicates that our model is performing well and reducing the error in tracking minority business ownership.
