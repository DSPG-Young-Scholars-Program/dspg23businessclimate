### Who We Are
#### [The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars Program](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/institute/divisions/social-and-decision-analytics/dspg)
Our program is brought to you by the University of Virginia's Biocomplexity Institute's [Social and Decision Analytics Division](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/institute/divisions/social-and-decision-analytics) (SDAD). DSPG is a 10 week summer program for undergraduate and graduate students from across the country. DSPG Young Scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, engineering, science and the social sciences to determine how information generated within communities and through local, state, and federal programs can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy.
